# Usage
Save an image that you want to use for your image logger and save it to your desktop so it may look like this
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Stray_kitten_Rambo002.jpg/1200px-Stray_kitten_Rambo002.jpg

While the exe has to be made with a stub maker and saved and not uploaded so keep this in mid. like this
C:\Users\urname\ThisPC\Downloads\stub.exe or whatever

So basically once you have set it up you can send the image to someone or a victim and when they click the image it will open the png as it is disguised as a exe and is basically hidden. If you made it with a webhook you will get something through there and you can also obfuscate your exe if u want to keep people from being it is  a sus file.

# Warning 

This tool demonstrates and makes it easy for people to one click and log you, also stop falling for the scams of a one click image logger where you drag a image from ur desktop to discord and it logs your cookies, those are all fake and try to rip you off as they sell for like $10 - 30 bucks and they would just block you. This community is like this so make sure that to prevent getting scammed and having real tools like this virus check it first using ilspy or something and decompile if its ok and also check the code before running . Only use this on your own PC and do not use it for a bad malicious intent otherwise you could get in trouble and i am not responsible for any damages. This might be the cloest one click method or image logge to steal 9 year olds stuff.
